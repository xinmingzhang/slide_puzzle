# Slide Puzzle

this file is for [Reddit Pygame Challenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/pygame/comments/4z36w8/challenge_slide_puzzle/)
special thanks for iminurnamez, he has shared a lot of awesome template py files. and this time I also use the sound from his former work. Well, I do not know whethe it works on your computer. ^ v ^ I have tried several method, but all failed in Python 2, so if you get it work well on Python 2, please tell me how to do it.
  - I only have tested it in Python 3 and in Windows.
  - run my_game.py in Python 3 to start the game
  - use wsad or arrow key to move the tile, hold on space trigger collective slide
  - in hard mode, the tile would unvisible if not in the correct position
  - I did not finish the 'Pick Your Own Achievements', instead I add the custom mode
  - the font I used is made for Chinese, so in custom mode, \u4e00 to \u9fa5 would be fine
  - Hope you enjoy it!

There still a lot of things I can do about this work, for example add AI to solve the puzzle(It is not easy). In fact what I really want to do is adding a cheat mode, in this mode, player can click and drag the tile. This inspiration from the magic cube, i always recover it by violent disassembly when I was young. Sorry that I did not do it. For one thing, due to my poor skill, for another thing, I want to empty myself for a while and prepare for pyweek 22. I really have not idea about all the themes...
